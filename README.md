> Nothing fancy here, just my [portfolio website][personal-website].

## What is this about?

- It's just a basic identity website. Nothing more [...as of now].
- I keep updating it as a part of learning new stuff like react, svelte or anything that I am just interested at the moment. The code is expected to be buggy and overly complicated, as a result.
- To test locally, run `npm install` followed by `npm run develop`.

Nonetheless, please feel free to browse, and leave feedbacks on the issue tracker. If you catch a typo, or something broken, please let me know.
