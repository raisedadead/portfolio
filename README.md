> Nothing fancy here, just my [portfolio website][personal-website].

## What is this about?

- This is my tiny property on the internet.
- I keep updating it as a part of learning new stuff like react, svelte or
  anything that I am just interested at the moment. The code is expected to be
  buggy and overly complicated, as a result.
- To test locally, run `pnpm install` followed by `pnpm develop`.

Nonetheless, please feel free to browse, and leave feedbacks on the issue
tracker. If you catch a typo, or something broken, please let me know.
