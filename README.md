## What is this about?

- Its just a basic identity website. Nothing more [... as of now].
- I keep updating it as  a part of learning [react][react-website]. The code is expected to be buggy and   overly complicated, as a result.
- To test locally, run `npm install` followed by `npm run develop`.

Nonetheless, please feel free to browse, and leave feedbacks on the issue tracker. If you catch a typo, or something broken, please let me know.
