# portfolio

> Nothing fancy here, just my [portfolio website][personal-website].

What is this about?

- Its just a basic identity website. Nothing more [... as of now].
- Currently I am rewriting it as  a part of learning [react][react-website].
- The code is expected to be buggy and overy complicated, as a result.
- To test locally, run `npm install` followed by `npm start`.

Nonetheless, please feel free to browse, and leave feedbacks on the issue tracker. If you catch a typo, or something broken, please let me know.
